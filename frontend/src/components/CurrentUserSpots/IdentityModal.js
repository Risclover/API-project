        <p>
          The Airbnb community works best when its members know and trust each
          other. Thatâ€™s why, before booking a home or experience, or becoming a
          host, we may ask you to confirm some account info.

              Having confirmed contact info gives your hosts, guests, and Airbnb
              a way to contact you about your reservations or your account.
              Hosts are required to confirm contact info before listing their
              homes, and guests must do the same before booking a reservation.
              You also need a verified phone number to complete identity
              verification.

              Airbnb checks that people are who they say they are by confirming
              identity information with third parties or by reviewing
              government-issued documents, like a government ID, passport, or
              national identity card.

              Airbnb does this differently depending on each person. This is
              because both the best data sources vary from country to country
              and our processes may evolve over time.
